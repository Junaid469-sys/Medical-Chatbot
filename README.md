# Medical-Chatbot
<p>Description:
Developed an AI-powered medical chatbot using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide instant medical assistance by querying large medical documents.</p>
<p>Key Responsibilities:

Implemented a 3-phase pipeline:
<br>**Memory Setup**: Loaded raw PDFs, created text chunks, generated vector embeddings, and stored them in FAISS.</br>
<br>**LLM Integration**: Connected Mistral (LLM) with FAISS using LangChain to enable memory retrieval.</br>
<br>**User Interface**: Built a responsive chatbot UI using Streamlit for real-time medical query resolution.
Utilized HuggingFace for accessing pre-trained models and integrated a full RAG pipeline for enhanced response accuracy.
Ensured modular architecture, simplifying future improvements like multi-document support and authentication</br>.</p>
<p><br>Tools & Technologies:</br>

<br>LangChain | HuggingFace | Mistral (LLM) | FAISS | Streamlit | Python | VS Code</br></p>
<p>
    <br>Impact:

Improved accuracy of medical responses with contextual knowledge retrieval from large medical texts.</br>
<br>Designed a scalable solution with modular phases, paving the way for future enhancements such as multi-document embeddings and user authentication.</br>
